My personal GitHub website auto-generated with JavaScript using the GitHub API.

## How to make your own

1. Fork this repo or [download](https://github.com/robsd/robsd.github.io/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract it.
2. Replace my username with your GitHub username at the top of the **js/script.js** file.
3. Optionally change the theme (light or dark) at the top of the **js/script.js** file.
4. You can host your website on GitHub by making your own repo called **username.github.io** (where **username** is your GitHub username) and enabling GitHub Pages in the repo settings.
